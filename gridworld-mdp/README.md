### 🌟 **Core Concept**
🔹 **Reinforcement Learning** is about an agent learning how to act in an environment to achieve a **goal** by maximizing **reward** through **interaction**.

---

### 🔄 **Agent–Environment Interaction**
🔹 The agent and environment interact in **discrete time steps**.  
🔹 The agent takes **actions** based on **states**, and receives **rewards**.

---

### 🎯 **Key Elements**
- 🎮 **Action (A):** What the agent chooses to do.  
- 🗺️ **State (S):** The situation or environment at a given time.  
- 💰 **Reward (R):** Feedback from the environment about how good the action was.

---

### 🧠 **Policy (π)**
🔹 A **policy** is a rule (often stochastic) that tells the agent which action to take in each state.

---

### 📈 **Objective**
🔹 The agent’s goal is to **maximize the total reward** (called **return**) it receives over time.

---

### 🧩 **Markov Decision Process (MDP)**
🔹 If the RL setup includes **well-defined probabilities**, it becomes a **Markov Decision Process**.  
🔹 In an **MDP**, the future depends only on the current state and action—not the past.

---

### 📦 **Finite MDP**
🔹 A **finite MDP** has **limited** sets of states, actions, and rewards.  
🔹 Most RL theory focuses on **finite MDPs**.

---

### 🔄 **Return (G)**
🔹 It is a function of **future rewards** that the agent tries to maximize.  
- ⏳ **Episodic Tasks:** End after a sequence (e.g., games). Use **undiscounted** return.  
- 🔁 **Continuing Tasks:** Go on forever. Use **discounted** return to reduce the value of delayed rewards.

---

### 📊 **Value Functions**
- 📌 **State Value (vπ):** Expected return from a state under policy π.  
- 🎯 **Action Value (qπ):** Expected return from a state-action pair under π.

---

### 🏆 **Optimal Policy and Value**
🔹 The **optimal value functions** (v*, q*) give the best return possible from any state or state-action pair.  
🔹 A policy is **optimal** if it is **greedy** with respect to v* or q*.

---

### 🧮 **Bellman Optimality Equations**
🔹 These are **consistency conditions** for the optimal value functions.  
🔹 Solving them helps find **optimal policies**.

---

### 📉 **Knowledge Scenarios**
- 📚 **Complete Knowledge:** Agent knows everything about the environment.  
- ❓ **Incomplete Knowledge:** Agent must **learn from experience**.

---

### 🧠 **Challenges**
🔹 Even with full knowledge, agents face limits due to **memory** and **computation** constraints.  
🔹 Real-world environments are large → Need **approximations** (not tables).

---

### 🌈 **Approximation**
🔹 RL focuses on **approximating optimal behavior** in large or unknown environments.

---

### 🧭 **Relation to Control Theory & AI**
🔹 RL evolved from **optimal control theory** and has connections to **psychology** and **AI**.  
🔹 MDPs are a **general framework** used in modern AI for **planning** and **decision making**.
