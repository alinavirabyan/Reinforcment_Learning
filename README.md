Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment, aiming to maximize cumulative rewards over time. Unlike supervised learning, where models are trained on labeled data, or unsupervised learning, which identifies patterns in unlabeled data, RL is based on learning through trial and error using feedback from the environment. The agent explores possible actions, receives rewards or penalties, and gradually learns an optimal strategy—or policy—for achieving its goals.

This repository contains a collection of classic Reinforcement Learning problems solved using foundational RL algorithms. The implementations are based on concepts and methods introduced in the book "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto. 
### Key Concepts:

- **Agent:** The entity that makes decisions and learns through interaction with the environment.

- **Environment:** Everything outside the agent that the agent interacts with.

- **State:** A representation of the environment’s condition as perceived by the agent at a given time.

- **Action:** A choice made by the agent that affects the environment.

- **Reward:** A scalar signal received from the environment in response to the agent’s action; it defines the goal in reinforcement learning.

- **Policy (π):** A mapping from perceived states of the environment to actions to be taken; the agent’s behavior function.

- **Value Function (V or Q):** A prediction of expected future rewards; it estimates how good it is for the agent to be in a given state or to perform a given action in a state.

RL has practical applications in fields such as **robotics**, **game AI**, **finance**, and **resource optimization**—anywhere sequential decisions matter.
