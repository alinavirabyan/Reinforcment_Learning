## 🧠✨ What is Reinforcement Learning?

**Reinforcement Learning (RL)** is a type of machine learning where an **agent** learns to make decisions by interacting with an **environment**. The goal?  
🎯 **Maximize total reward over time!**

## 🧩 Core Concepts

| 🧱 | **Concept** | **Meaning** |
|----|-------------|--------------|
| 🧍 | **Agent** | The decision-maker or learner |
| 🌍 | **Environment** | Where the agent operates |
| 🧭 | **State (S)** | A situation the agent can be in |
| 🎮 | **Action (A)** | A move or decision the agent makes |
| 💰 | **Reward (R)** | Feedback signal (positive or negative) |
| 🧑‍🏫 | **Policy (π)** | A strategy that maps states → actions |
| 📈 | **Value Function (V)** | Expected total future reward from a state |

## ⚙️ Algorithms in This Project

This project uses **Dynamic Programming (DP)** methods, assuming complete knowledge of the environment:

### 🔁 Policy Evaluation  
📏 Estimate how good a given policy is (value of states under that policy)

### 🚀 Value Iteration  
♻️ Use the Bellman Optimality Equation to improve value estimates  
🏆 Derive the **optimal policy** from those values

### 🧠 Policy Iteration  
1️⃣ Evaluate current policy  
2️⃣ Improve it based on updated values  
3️⃣ Repeat until it becomes optimal

## 🎮 Why It’s Cool

- Teaches agents to learn by **trial and error** 🧪  
- Shows how machines can **improve over time** 🔄  
- Used in real-world applications like games, robotics, and self-driving cars 🚗🤖🎲
